Vibe Index - Definition and Computation

What it is
- Composite score to rank labels (genres/subtags) by expected opportunity: high forecasted popularity, low risk (volatility).

Inputs per label
- Forecasted popularity (pop): sum of ARIMA forecast means over the horizon.
- Average volatility (vol): mean of GARCH(1,1) volatility forecasts over the horizon.

Normalization (min–max over candidates)
- pop_nrm = (pop - pop_min) / max(eps, pop_max - pop_min)
- vol_raw = (vol - vol_min) / max(eps, vol_max - vol_min)
  where eps = 1e-9.

Risk penalty with popularity dampening
- risk = vol_raw ^ gamma
- eff_risk = risk * (1 - reward_dampen * pop_nrm)
- vol_nrm = 1 - eff_risk

Composite index (weighted blend)
- composite_index = (w_pop * pop_nrm + w_vol * vol_nrm) / max(eps, w_pop + w_vol)

Parameters
- gamma (RISK_GAMMA) > 0: nonlinearity of volatility penalty (larger => penalize high vol more).
- reward_dampen in [0,1]: reduces effective risk for already-popular labels.
- w_pop, w_vol: weights for popularity vs. (inverted) risk.
- eps = 1e-9: numeric stability.

Interpretation
- Higher composite_index is better (more popular and/or less risky after dampening).
- For similar popularity, lower volatility ranks higher.
- Popularity can partially offset volatility via reward_dampen, but extreme risk remains penalized as gamma increases.

Scope
- The umbrella label "— other" is excluded from overall ranking.
- Normalization is computed over the candidate set used in each run.

Provenance
- ARIMA for popularity (with ADF tests, residual diagnostics, simple holdout backtests).
- GARCH(1,1) for volatility on log-returns (ARCH-LM, Ljung–Box, Jarque–Bera diagnostics).
